# MCP Tools Basic

- Have a clear idea what you want the tool to do
- Create a structured output instead of sending raw output of result to LLM
- Think about different scenarios and error cases which a tool might encounter
- Try to have meaningful error messages with a consistent structure
- Test well with different LLM Vendor to make sure tool performance as expected.
